There are [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kkTsCrMIVtxYef9T7SV-MWS-nQlnmTniAGaTl6L9Fe4/edit?usp=sharing) that go with this repo, as well as a [companion website](https://rtfeldman-rust-workshop.netlify.app/).

Getting Started
===============

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) 1.51 or higher

2. Install [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) 1.51 or higher

3. Not required, but **highly** recommended: install [`rustfmt`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt#on-the-stable-toolchain) and configure your editor to run it on save.

Verify that you have the right version of cargo by running:

```shell
cargo --version
```

It should print a version number of 1.51 or higher.

Finally, clone this repository by running this at the terminal:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/rtfeldman/intro-to-rust
cd intro-to-rust
```

You're all set!
